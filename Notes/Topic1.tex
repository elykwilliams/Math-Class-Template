Totally fell asleep in \coursename $\ldots$ \prof  wasn't happy.

I'd like to have the notes be the tutorial with examples, and then setup the homework with simple exercises. Also would like to start building up a set of Math Macros designed for math majors to get up and running quicker. 

Note that if the subfiles document class is used, each tex file can be compiled individually; this is so all the notes/homework can be compiled at once, or individually so homework can be submitted.
